To create the diagram based on your description, let's visualize the relationships between various entities such as global definitions, instances, environments, builds, infrastructure, stacks, components, platform, and products. Here's how it can be represented:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  // First row
  A["Global definition"] --> B["Instance X"];
  A --> C["Environment X"];
  A --> D["Build X"];
  A --> E["Product X"];
  
  // Second row
  B --> F["Platform X"];
  C --> G["Infra Y"];
  D --> H["Stacks X"];
  
  // Third row
  G --> I["Host Y"];
  H --> J["Component X"];
  J --> I["Host X"];
  F --> I["Host X"];
  E --> I["Host X"];
```

### Explanation:

- **Global definition** (Box A): Represents the overarching definitions and configurations.
- **Instances** (Box B): Specifically Instance X, which could be a particular deployment instance.
- **Environments** (Box C): Environment X, where applications are deployed and tested.
- **Builds** (Box D): Build X, which generates release artifacts.
- **Products** (Box E): Product X, the final deliverable.
- **Platform** (Box F): Platform X, providing the infrastructure and tools for applications.
- **Infrastructure** (Box G): Infra Y, underlying infrastructure services.
- **Stacks** (Box H): Stacks X, grouping of components.
- **Hosts** (Box I): Host Y and Host X, where components and applications run.
- **Components** (Box J): Component X, part of Stacks X.

### Connections:

- From Global definition (A):
  - Points to Instance X (B), Environment X (C), Build X (D), and Product X (E).
- Instance X (B):
  - Points to Platform X (F).
- Environment X (C):
  - Points to Infrastructure Y (G).
- Build X (D):
  - Points to Stacks X (H).
- Infrastructure Y (G):
  - Points to Host Y (I).
- Stacks X (H):
  - Points to Component X (J).
- Component X (J):
  - Points to Host X (I).
- Platform X (F):
  - Points to Host X (I).
- Product X (E):
  - Points to Host X (I).

This diagram visualizes the flow and relationships between different entities in your infrastructure and deployment pipeline, highlighting how definitions, instances, environments, builds, stacks, components, platform, and products interconnect and ultimately contribute to the final hosted environment on Host X. Adjustments can be made to the diagram style and labels based on specific nuances or additional details in your system architecture.










## Infrastructure Diagram

### Using Playbooks

* Define environments, instances, hosts, and host configuration (hosts, build-releases-, stack-, and the lists of components files)
* Define component version by release
* Define all available components
* Define groups of components and versions by group (stacks)
* Define components and release to use for each environment (internal_platform)

### Structure of environments (apps/isdt), instances (sbx, dev, devint, qa, prod), and worker nodes

* Define the infrastructure of all available components
* Define the components for each stacks
* Define the environments (apps or isdt), the stacks, and the release used by each environment
* Define all infrastructure and platform components
