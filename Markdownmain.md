It seems there was an issue with the Mermaid diagram syntax. Let's correct that and create the diagram as intended:

```mermaid
graph TD;
  // First row
  A["Global definition"] --> B["Instance X"];
  A --> C["Environment X"];
  A --> D["Build X"];
  A --> E["Product X"];
  
  // Second row
  B --> F["Platform X"];
  C --> G["Infra Y"];
  D --> H["Stacks X"];
  
  // Third row
  G --> I["Host Y"];
  H --> J["Component X"];
  J --> I["Host X"];
  F --> I["Host X"];
  E --> I["Host X"];
```

### Explanation:

- **Global definition** (Box A): Represents the overarching definitions and configurations.
- **Instance X** (Box B): A specific instance or deployment environment.
- **Environment X** (Box C): An environment where applications are deployed and tested.
- **Build X** (Box D): Represents a build process that generates release artifacts.
- **Product X** (Box E): The final product or deliverable.
- **Platform X** (Box F): Provides infrastructure and tools for applications.
- **Infrastructure Y** (Box G): Represents underlying infrastructure services.
- **Stacks X** (Box H): Groups of components used in the deployment.
- **Hosts** (Box I): Hosts where components and applications are deployed and run.
- **Component X** (Box J): Specific components within Stacks X.

### Connections:

- **Global definition** (A):
  - Points to Instance X (B), Environment X (C), Build X (D), and Product X (E).
- **Instance X** (B):
  - Points to Platform X (F).
- **Environment X** (C):
  - Points to Infrastructure Y (G).
- **Build X** (D):
  - Points to Stacks X (H).
- **Infrastructure Y** (G):
  - Provides resources to Host Y (I).
- **Stacks X** (H):
  - Contains Component X (J).
- **Component X** (J):
  - Deploys on Host X (I).
- **Platform X** (F):
  - Also utilizes Host X (I).
- **Product X** (E):
  - Deploys to Host X (I).

This diagram illustrates the flow and relationships between various elements in your infrastructure and deployment process, from global definitions down to specific components deployed on hosts. Adjustments can be made to the diagram based on additional details or specific configurations within your system architecture.










## Infrastructure Diagram

### Using Playbooks

* Define environments, instances, hosts, and host configuration (hosts, build-releases-, stack-, and the lists of components files)
* Define component version by release
* Define all available components
* Define groups of components and versions by group (stacks)
* Define components and release to use for each environment (internal_platform)

### Structure of environments (apps/isdt), instances (sbx, dev, devint, qa, prod), and worker nodes

* Define the infrastructure of all available components
* Define the components for each stacks
* Define the environments (apps or isdt), the stacks, and the release used by each environment
* Define all infrastructure and platform components
